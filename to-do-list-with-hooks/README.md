problems during project:

when I make POST api call, I am not under the same domain as server side, I got CORS issues, I have no permission to finish the API call.

Then I stopped My coding, Next step will be create Route and redirect and logout button functionality, for now the login varible in Todolist component is just dummy data,  because I can't call API succefully without permision from server side.

the current code took almost 4 hours, the start framwork setup and debug did take some time. 


Thank you for working through my code.
